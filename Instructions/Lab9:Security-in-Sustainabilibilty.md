# Lab 01 - Setup Sentinel Environment

## Lab overview
In the initial phase of setting up the security infrastructure, the focus is on creating essential components to monitor and analyze security events. This involves establishing a Log Analytics workspace and integrating Microsoft Sentinel into the workspace, laying the foundation for subsequent security measures.

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will undertake the essential task of setting up Log Analytics, which provides a centralized location to store and query data, while Sentinel serves as the platform for advanced security analysis, also enabling proactive threat detection and incident response.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create Sentinel Workspace

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

# Lab 06 - Ingest Logs from Microsoft Entra ID

## Lab Overview
Gain insights into Microsoft Entra ID by connecting Audit and Sign-in logs to Microsoft Sentinel to gather insights around Microsoft Entra ID scenarios. You can learn about app usage, conditional access policies, legacy auth relate details using our Sign-in logs. You can get information on your Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) usage, Microsoft Entra ID Management activities like user, group, role, app management using our Audit logs table.

## Lab scenario
Microsoft Entra ID is an integrated cloud identity and access solution. In this lab, you will enable the ingestion of logs from Microsoft Entra ID into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to enhance security monitoring and analytical capabilities.

## Lab objectives 
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Install Microsoft Entra ID data connector to Sentinel
- Task 2: Set up the data connector to ingest logs to workspace
- Task 3: View data ingested into Microsoft Sentinel

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes
