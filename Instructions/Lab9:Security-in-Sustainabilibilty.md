# Lab 09 - Security in Sustainability

## Lab overview
In the initial phase of setting up the security infrastructure, the focus is on creating essential components to monitor and analyze security events. This involves establishing a Log Analytics workspace and integrating Microsoft Sentinel into the workspace, laying the foundation for subsequent security measures.

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will undertake the essential task of setting up Log Analytics, which provides a centralized location to store and query data, while Sentinel serves as the platform for advanced security analysis, also enabling proactive threat detection and incident response.


## Excercise 1 - Setup Sentinel Workspace

### Task 1: Create Sentinel Workspace

In this task, you will create Microsoft Sentinel workspace where you will be monitoring and analyzing security events in upcoming labs.

1.  On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select **Microsoft Sentinel** under services.
