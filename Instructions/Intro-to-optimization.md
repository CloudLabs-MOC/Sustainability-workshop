## Key Features of Azure Carbon Optimization

- Granular Emissions Data in Azure Portal:
   Azure Carbon Optimization offers detailed emissions data at the resource level, covering the past 12 months for all your Azure products and services. To access this data for your subscriptions, navigate to the Azure portal and search for Carbon Optimization.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  Access to emissions data is governed by Azure RBAC. You must be assigned at least one of the following roles at the subscription level to view emissions data: owner, contributor, or carbon optimization roles.

- Detailed Breakdowns:
   View emissions data broken down by subscription, resource group, individual resource, service, and location. This allows you to understand how your carbon emissions are distributed and identify which areas contribute the most to your overall emissions.

- REST APIs and Data Exports:
  Programmatically access your emissions data using REST APIs, or export it to CSV format. This enables integration with other tools or platforms for further analysis or reporting.

- Carbon Reduction Recommendations:
  Receive optimization recommendations based on your resource utilization. These recommendations might include switching to more efficient SKUs or reducing idle or unused resources. You can also view the estimated carbon savings and cost implications of each recommendation.
