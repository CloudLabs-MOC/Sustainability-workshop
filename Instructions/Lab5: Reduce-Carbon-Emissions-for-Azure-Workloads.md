# Lab 5: Reduce Carbon Emissions for Azure Workloads

## Lab Scenario
Your company wants to reduce its carbon footprint by optimizing its Azure cloud workloads. You'll review current deployments and analyze carbon emissions data to find ways to reduce emissions.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will review your current Azure deployments to understand their configurations and usage patterns. You will then use tools like the Carbon optimization to view and analyze carbon emissions data. Based on this analysis, you will identify opportunities for optimization and generate reports to visualize the impact of these changes.

## Lab Objective
The primary objective of this lab is to enable participants to understand and implement strategies for reducing carbon emissions associated with Azure workloads. By the end of this lab, participants will be able to:

   - Review and assess existing Azure deployments to understand their current state and resource utilization.
   - Analyze and interpret carbon emissions data from the existing Azure resources.
   - Identify opportunities and best practices for optimizing Azure workloads to minimize carbon emissions.
   - Implement changes and monitor the impact of these optimizations on carbon emissions.

### Task 1 : Review the Existing Azure Deployments

9. Go to Microsoft [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/home?experience=power-bi), select the Apps on the left navigation pane. You see the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 and select the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure listed on the Apps page.

    ![](../media/report27.png)

10. You will be navigated to **Emissions Impact Dashboard**.

      ![](../media/report26.png)

    You successfully installed the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure and Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 applications.

11. The Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure has multiple tabs that detail a range of metrics.

    ![](../media/report31.png)
    
13. The dashboard provides insight into emissions that are generated based on an organization's use of Microsoft Cloud services. Key fact boxes across the upper left of the page provide visibility into carbon emissions, total cloud usage, and carbon intensity, which is a measure of efficiency.

     ![](../media/report32.png)
    
14. While most cloud services only provide a view into scope 1 and 2 emission types, Microsoft takes emissions analysis one step further by also providing visibility to scope 3 emissions.

15. **Emissions savings** lets organizations view the carbon emissions savings from running on Microsoft Cloud versus an on-premises alternative. On the efficiency scale, organizations can select their level of efficiency to be low, medium, or high by using the criteria on the right side of the page's guidance.

      ![](../media/report35.png)
      
16. **GHG preparation** report helps organizations prepare internal or external sustainability reports. You can filter by time horizon, yearly, monthly, and quarterly, in addition to subscription name and ID, Azure service, Azure region, and scope type. You can export this report to Microsoft Excel for further analysis and reporting. 

     ![](../media/report33.png)

17. **Usage report** helps organizations know the usage hours of Azure services across all available subscriptions. The usage hours are based on the sum of the organizationâ€™s compute, storage, and data transfer in Microsoft Cloud. You can filter and export a usage report.

    ![](../media/report34.png)

     - The emission impact dashboard for Microsoft 365 is a Power Bi Application which provides a transparent, quantitative picture of the greenhourse gas emissions associated with your organization's use of the Microsoft 365 cloud services like Teams calling and file storage in SharePoint.

12. The dashboard shows the total monthly metric tons of emissions Microsoft produces on your organization's behalf, including segamentation by data center, region, and scope.

13. The methodology that powers this data has been independently verified by a third party and includes all three scopes of the emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas protocol. Not Just the emissions aasociated with electricity consumption, but also emissions from the upstream supply chain for data center hardware.

14. On the **Carbon intensity** tab, you can see the average monthly emission associated with a single Microsoft 365 user in your organizations.
You can also compare that number to other common sources of the emissions, like driving a car or charging a smartphone.

15. The **Emission Savings** tab  provides an estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions your organization has already avoided by using cloud instead of on premises versions of exchange and SharePoint.

16. Research has shown that the  Microsoft cloud is up to 98% more Carbon efficient that on premises alternatives. You can customize the estimate by selecting the efficiency of your on premises alternative and volume of renewable energy your organization purchases.
