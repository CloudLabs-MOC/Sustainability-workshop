# Lab 3.1: Import Sustainability Data 


## Lab Overview

The **Data Ingestion** aspect of the Solution Focus Area. It follows the **Organization and Reference data Set up** and forms the basis for the emission calculations and the reporting thereafter. The Microsoft Sustainability Manager is flexible with multiple automated options to ingest data – such as the connectors as well as manual inputs.

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, for Wide World Importers utilizes the activity data Excel spreadsheets will be sourced – Emissions Analyst. The Activity data spreadsheets contain Electricity Purchased for the year 2023 and Miles driven by the fleet of Fabrikam Electric Trucks for the calendar year 2023. You observes that associated information such as product, model and Vehicle size needs to be added as custom dimension meta data before importing which are required to run the emission calculation and gather the Emission insights reports for monitoring. After adding this information, you can use Microsoft Sustainability Manger’s connector functionality to import from the Excel spreadsheets, and reviews other connectors available for future purposes. We uses the built-in Power Query functionality to transform the data to match Microsoft Sustainability Manager’s data schema and looks for other potential issues such as case-sensitive d data fields.

### Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Add custom dimension metadata
- Task 2: Import 2023 data for “Purchased Electricity“ for Facilities
- Task 3: Import 2023 Miles Driven data for electric trucks

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

### Task 1: Add custom dimension metadata

In this task, we will enrich the Excel spreadsheet Purchased electricity Wide World Importers 2023.xlsx by adding custom dimensions metadata for mapping before importing the data.

1. Back in the Sustainability Manager portal, from the left navigation pane select **Custom dimensions (1)** and navigate to the **Custom dimensions (2)** tab under **Data**, then click **+ New (3)** at the top right of the **Active Custom dimensions** page.

1. Please enter the following details to create custom dimension metadata :

    - **Logical name** - **Product (1)**
   
    - **Display name** – **Product (2)**

    - **Description** - **Product (This is optional) (3)**
  	
    - Click **Save & Close (4)**.

   ![image](../media/lab01-30.png)
 
1. Repeat the previous steps to create two custom dimension metadata as follows.

      -	**Logical name** - **Model (1)**
      
      -	**Display name** - **Model (2)**

      -   Click **Save & Close (3)**

           ![image](../media/lab01-31.png)
     
      -	**Logical name** - **Vehicle Size** 
      
      -	**Display name** – **Vehicle Size**
      
      - Click **Save & Close (3)**

    >**Note** - Wait for the transformations to be applied properly, before you click **Create**, else you may get an error.
    
1. The **New data connection** wizard will now be on the **Schedule data** **import** page, where you'll complete the following actions:

     - Turn on the **Import data automatically** toggle to allow the option to set a schedule for the data to be imported automatically. Selecting this     
        option is beneficial if the connector will be used in a scenario where the data will change frequently, such as a web API or FTP server.

     - Turn on the **Replace previously imported data** toggle to remove all previously imported data and bring in the full dataset that was retrieved. 
         Selecting this option is beneficial if the data source isn't providing data from only the last import or if it always includes a full set of data. For 
         this scenario of importing historical data, leave both options turned off.

      - Select **Next** when finished.
